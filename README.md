# SortingAlgorithms
This code contains several sorting algorithms implemented using C++. The three algorithms used in this are INSERTION-SORT, MERGE-SORT, and QUICK-SORT. Firstly, insertion sort is a type of brute force approach that sorts a subarray from 0 to j then iterated through the next element and places the new value in its proper location in the array, it repeats this until the array is fully sorted RT=O(n^2). Secondly merge sort is a heavily recursive comparison algorithm that breaks the sorting into several sub problems and quickly merges the smaller sorted problems back together RT=O(nlgn). Finally quick-sort  is a very efficient sorting algorithm; however, not as stable as merge sort is. In practice quick-sort works very well normally having a RT=O(nlgn) but in certain cases it can perform poorly, having the worst case RT=O(n^2). This occurs when the array is already sorted, other than that it often will outperform something like merge-sort. The experiment detailed in this is written in C++ and will generate arrays of 5000, 10000, ..., 100000 elements with random values generated from 1 to 'bounds' defined at the top. Each sorting attempt is done a total of 'm', also defined at the top, and then after all three algorithms run takes the average run time of each set of runs.
